## What is Ergo?

Ergo is a domain specific language (DSL) to capture the logic of
*legal* contracts.

**_Both the design and implementation of the language are still in early stages. We encourage you to visit this site regularly for updates and future releases information._**

## Overview

Here are Ergo's high-level goals:
are:
- to have contracts and clauses as first-class elements of the language
- to help legal-tech developers quickly and safely write computable legal contracts
- to be modular, facilitating reuse of existing contract or clause logic
- to ensure safe execution: the language should prevent run-time errors and non-terminating logic
- to be blockchain neutral: the same contract logic can be executed either on and off chain on a variety of distributed ledger technologies
- to be formally specified: the meaning of contracts should be well defined so it can be verified, and preserved during execution
- to be consistent with the [Accord Project Template Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UacA_r2KGcBA2D4voDgGE8jqid-Uh4Dt09AE-shBKR0)

## Status and Contributions

Ergo is developed as an open standard as part of the <a href="https://www.accordproject.org">Accord Project</a>. An open-source implementation is tracking the standard closely, and is available as an npm package or on [github](https://github.com/accordproject/ergo). Installation instructions can be found [here](http://ergo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html).

Information about how to contribute to Ergo can be found in [contributing.md](https://github.com/accordproject/ergo/blob/master/contribute-to-ergo/contributing.md).
