title: If Statements (Conditional Expressions)
---

Conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.  Conditional expressions (also known as `if` statements) allow us to conditionally execute Ergo code depending on the value of a test condition. If the test condition evaluates to `true` then the code on the `then` branch is evaluated. Otherwise, when the test condition evaluates to `false` then the `else` branch is evaluated.

Example
-------

``` {.sourceCode .js}
if delayInDays > 15 then
  new BuyerMayTerminateResponse{};
else 
  new BuyerMayNotTerminateResponse{}
```

Legal Prose
-----------

For example, this corresponds to a conditional logic statement in legal
prose.

    If the delay is more than 15 days, the Buyer is entitled to terminate this Contract.

Syntax
------

    if expression1 then     // Condition
      expression2           // Expression if condition is true
    else
      expression3           // Expression if condition is false

Where `expression1` is an Ergo expression that evaluates to a Boolean
value (i.e. `true` or `false`), and `expression2` and `expression3` are
Ergo expressions.

> Note that as with all Ergo expressions, new lines and indentation
> don't change the meaning of your code. However it is good practice to
> standardise the way that you using whitespace in your code to make it
> easier to read.

Usage
-----

If statements can be chained , i.e., `if ... then .... else if ... then ... else ...` to build more compound conditionals.

``` {.sourceCode .js}
if request.netAnnualChargeVolume < contract.firstVolume then
  return new VolumeDiscountResponse{ discountRate: contract.firstRate }
else if request.netAnnualChargeVolume < contract.secondVolume then 
  return new VolumeDiscountResponse{ discountRate: contract.secondRate }
else 
  return new VolumeDiscountResponse{ discountRate: contract.thirdRate }
```

Conditional expressions can also be used in [variable declarations](ergo-variable-declarations.md).

``` {.sourceCode .js}
define variable price = 42;
define variable message =  if price > 100 then "High price" else "Low Price";
message;
```

The value of message after running this code will be `"Low Price"`.
