# The Emacs mode for Ergo

Install this plugin via Pathogen by moving this directory from wherever you
found it to the directory `~/.vim/bundle/ergo.vim` (and ensuring that
`pathogen#infect()` is in your `~/.vimrc` file).

## Installation

Install this mode by placing `ergo-mode.el` in a directory of your choice, and adding the following lines to your `emacs.d` configuration:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/place/where/you/put/it/")
    (require 'ergo-mode)
