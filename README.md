## About

This is the source code for the Ergo compiler. Ergo is the [Accord Project][apmain]
language for Smart Legal Contracts.

The Ergo compiler is distributed as an [npm package][npmpkg]. 

The Ergo compiler is written using the [Coq][coq] proof assistant, with parsing and
support code written in [OCaml][OCaml]. It makes extensive use
of the [Q*cert compiler][Qcert] for code generation and type checking.

Both the Ergo language and its compiler are in early development
phase. If you would like to build from source or to contribute,
consult the [DEVELOPERS][developers] file.

## Try Ergo online

If you want to take a peek at Ergo without installing anything, check
out the interactive [REPL][REPL]
(read-eval-print-loop) for Ergo stand-alone, or the [Accord Project Template Studio][studio] 
which illustrates Ergo in Accord Project templates.

## Documentation

The most recent Ergo documentation is in the [Ergo Language Guide][docergo].

## Quickstart

### Install Ergo

The easiest way to install Ergo is as a [Node.js][nodejs] package.
Once you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can get the Ergo compiler
and command-line using the Node.js package manager by typing the following in a
terminal:

```text
$ npm install -g @accordproject/ergo-cli
```

This will install the compiler itself (`ergoc`) and command-line tools (`ergorun` and `ergotop`) to create and invoke Ergo contracts. You can check that both have been installed and print the version number by typing the following in a terminal:

```text
$ ergoc --version
$ ergorun --version
```

Then, to get command line help:

```text
$ ergoc --help
$ ergorun --help
```

### Compile a contract

To compile your first Ergo contract to JavaScript:

```text
$ ergoc ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo
15:17:08 - info: Logging initialized. 2018-05-24T19:17:08.024Z
Processing file: ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo -- compiled to: ./examples/volumediscount/logic.js
```

By default, Ergo compiles to JavaScript for execution. You can inspect
the compiled JavaScript code in `./examples/volumediscount/logic.js`

### Invoke a contract

To compile and execute a contract by sending a request:

```text
$ ergorun execute ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo --contract ./examples/volumediscount/contract.json --request ./examples/volumediscount/request.json --state ./examples/volumediscount/state.json
06:40:01 - info:
{
  "response": {
    "discountRate": 2.8,
    "$class": "org.accordproject.volumediscount.VolumeDiscountResponse"
  },
  "state": {
    "$class": "org.accordproject.cicero.contract.AccordContractState",
    "stateId": "1"
  },
  "emit": []
}
```

To compile and invoke a specific contract clause:

```text
$ ergorun invoke ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo --clauseName volumediscount --contract ./examples/volumediscount/contract.json --params ./examples/volumediscount/params.json --state ./examples/volumediscount/state.json
```

To compile and obtain the initial state for the contract:

```text
$ ergorun init ./examples/volumediscount/model.cto ./examples/volumediscount/logic.ergo --contract ./examples/volumediscount/contract.json
06:40:29 - info:
```
